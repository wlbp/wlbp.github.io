<p>The Amateur Radio Emergency ServiceÂ® (ARES) consists of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment, with their local ARES leadership, for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes.</p>

<a name="fieldday" class="anchor" href="#fieldday"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Field Day 2013</h2>

<p>This was our first Field Day as an ARES group. Most local ARES members participated. We set up at Cloudland Canyon State Park on Lookout Mountain. It was a perfect spot for antennas and public relations. We estimate 150 to 200 members of the public stopped by to check out what we were doing. The manager and rangers of the state park could not have been more helpful or gracious. We give them our thanks.</p>
<p>Operators learned to set up and operate under emergency conditions. There was even a contact with the International Space Station.</p>
